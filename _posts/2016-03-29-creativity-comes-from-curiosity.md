Creativity comes from Curiosity.

The team that we've formed have many things in common:  
Live Events  
Movies  
Series  
Viral Videos  
Magic  
Wonder  
... and above all ... Curiosity.  
Our desire to dig at questions and find ways to discover if the truth can be known keeps coming to the forefront of any idea ... story ... project we dream up.  
Our launch project is a documentary called ... The Supernatural Project ... and it asks the question "Ever Wonder Where Magic Comes From?"  
We hope that be the time we release this movie (currently in production) ... we'll have some interesting answers to this question.
